# $

Make command paste-safe

## Thanks @Rinwasyu !

The original author of `$` is [@Rinwasyu](https://github.com/Rinwasyu)! He made the implementation of `$` in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Rinwasyu/status/1204738450496163840). I'm just a man to propose the idea of `$` and host it on GitHub.

## Install on macOS

```console
$ brew install nwtgck/homebrew-dollar/dollar
```

## Usage

Here is an example. Note that `$ $` is not typo.

```console
$ $ echo hello
```
